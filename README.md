# CS423 Graph Processing

Implement algorithms that compute:

*  The number of triangles in a graph  
*  The size of the largest connected component in a graph  

For each of these algorithms, generate charts that characterize the performance of these algorithms on Erdos-Renyi binomial graphs with n=[0-1M] and p=[0-0.3]. You may have to be clever in how densely you explore this space based on estimates of how much time each experiment takes. I might start with 9 trials n=1K,10K,100K and p=0.05,0.1,0.2 to sketch the middle of the space and then build out from there.
